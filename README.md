echo "# Video Frame Interpolation and Super Resolution"

echo "This repository provides implementations for **Video Frame Interpolation** using **RIFE** and **Super Resolution** using **ESRGAN**. It enhances video quality by generating smooth interpolated frames and upscaling low-resolution videos using deep learning models. Pre-trained models and custom training options are included for flexibility."

echo "## Features"
echo "- **Frame Interpolation (RIFE)**: Generate high-quality intermediate frames to smooth motion or change video frame rates."
echo "- **Super Resolution (ESRGAN)**: Enhance low-resolution videos or frames using state-of-the-art deep learning models to predict high-resolution outputs."
echo "- **Pre-trained Models**: Ready-to-use pre-trained models for both interpolation (RIFE) and super resolution (ESRGAN)."
echo "- **Customizable**: Easily train with your own dataset for custom video enhancement needs."

echo "## Requirements"
echo "The following dependencies are required to run the project:"
echo "- Python 3.6+"
echo "- PyTorch (>=1.7.0)"
echo "- OpenCV (>=4.5.0)"
echo "- NumPy (>=1.19.0)"
echo "- tqdm (>=4.50.0)"
echo "- scikit-image (>=0.18.3)"
echo "- FFmpeg (for video processing)"
echo "- CUDA-enabled GPU (Recommended for better performance)"

echo "You can install the necessary dependencies using:"

echo "```bash"
echo "pip install -r requirements.txt"
echo "```"

echo "## Setup"

echo "1. Clone the repository:"

echo "```bash"
echo "git clone https://github.com/yourusername/video-frame-interpolation-super-resolution.git"
echo "cd video-frame-interpolation-super-resolution"
echo "```"

echo "2. Install dependencies:"

echo "```bash"
echo "pip install -r requirements.txt"
echo "```"

echo "3. Download pre-trained models (optional but recommended):"
echo "- **ESRGAN**: Pre-trained models can be downloaded from [here](link-to-esrgan-model)."
echo "- **RIFE**: Pre-trained models can be downloaded from [here](link-to-rife-model)."

echo "4. Set up FFmpeg to handle video file conversion, or use the default methods provided in the code."

echo "## Usage"

echo "### Frame Interpolation (RIFE)"
echo "To perform frame interpolation on a video, run the following command:"

echo "```bash"
echo "python frame_interpolation.py --input_video path_to_input_video.mp4 --output_video path_to_output_video.mp4"
echo "```"

echo "### Super Resolution (ESRGAN)"
echo "To perform super resolution on a frame or image, run:"

echo "```bash"
echo "python super_resolution.py --input_image path_to_input_image.jpg --output_image path_to_output_image.jpg"
echo "```"

echo "### Training Your Own Model"
echo "To train a model from scratch using your own dataset, use the following:"

echo "```bash"
echo "python train.py --dataset_path path_to_your_dataset --output_dir path_to_save_model"
echo "```"

echo "Make sure to preprocess your data and split it into training and testing sets."

echo "## Example"
echo "Here is an example of using the frame interpolation and super resolution pipeline:"

echo "1. **Step 1**: First, enhance the resolution of the low-resolution video using ESRGAN."

echo "```bash"
echo "python super_resolution.py --input_video low_res_video.mp4 --output_video high_res_video.mp4"
echo "```"

echo "2. **Step 2**: Then, apply frame interpolation using RIFE to generate additional frames."

echo "```bash"
echo "python frame_interpolation.py --input_video high_res_video.mp4 --output_video smooth_video.mp4"
echo "```"
