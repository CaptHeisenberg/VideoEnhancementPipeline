# Video Frame Interpolation and Super Resolution

This repository provides implementations for **Video Frame Interpolation** using **RIFE** and **Super Resolution** using **ESRGAN**. It enhances video quality by generating smooth interpolated frames and upscaling low-resolution videos using deep learning models. Pre-trained models and custom training options are included for flexibility.

## Features

- **Frame Interpolation (RIFE)**: Generate high-quality intermediate frames to smooth motion or change video frame rates.
- **Super Resolution (ESRGAN)**: Enhance low-resolution videos or frames using state-of-the-art deep learning models to predict high-resolution outputs.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Ready-to-use pre-trained models for both interpolation (RIFE) and super resolution (ESRGAN).
- **Customizable**: Easily train with your own dataset for custom video enhancement needs.

## Requirements

The following dependencies are required to run the project:

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch (>=1.7.0)
- OpenCV (>=4.5.0)
- NumPy (>=1.19.0)
- tqdm (>=4.50.0)
- scikit-image (>=0.18.3)
- FFmpeg (for video processing)
- CUDA-enabled GPU (Recommended for better performance)

You can install the necessary dependencies using:

``'bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Setup
Clone the repository:'

'''bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/video-frame-interpolation-super-resolution.git
cd video-frame-interpolation-super-resolution
Install dependencies:

'''bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download pre-trained models (optional but recommended):

ESRGAN: Pre-trained models can be downloaded from here.

RIFE: Pre-trained models can be downloaded from here.

Set up FFmpeg to handle video file conversion, or use the default methods provided in the code.

Usage
Frame Interpolation (RIFE)
To perform frame interpolation on a video, run the following command:

bash
Copy
python frame_interpolation.py --input_video path_to_input_video.mp4 --output_video path_to_output_video.mp4
Super Resolution (ESRGAN)
To perform super resolution on a frame or image, run:

bash
Copy
python super_resolution.py --input_image path_to_input_image.jpg --output_image path_to_output_image.jpg
Training Your Own Model
To train a model from scratch using your own dataset, use the following:

bash
Copy
python train.py --dataset_path path_to_your_dataset --output_dir path_to_save_model
Make sure to preprocess your data and split it into training and testing sets.

Example
Here is an example of using the frame interpolation and super resolution pipeline:

Step 1: First, enhance the resolution of the low-resolution video using ESRGAN.

bash
Copy
python super_resolution.py --input_video low_res_video.mp4 --output_video high_res_video.mp4
Step 2: Then, apply frame interpolation using RIFE to generate additional frames.

bash
Copy
python frame_interpolation.py --input_video high_res_video.mp4 --output_video smooth_video.mp4
